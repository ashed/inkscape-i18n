This is where tutorial sources are kept in DocBook format 
(with SVG illustrations).

Place each tutorial and its illustrations into a subdirectory. An example is
basic/ with the Basic Tutorial.

When converting an existing SVG tutorial, pull out the illustrations from it 
into separate files (using copy/paste). Preserve horizontal placement (paste 
via Ctrl+Alt+V), then vertically align the top of the illustration with the top
of the canvas. (The size of canvas does not matter.)

In the DocBook source (*.xml), the intro (italic) is in <abstract>; each 
section is in <sect1> with <title>; each para is in <para>; keyboard shortcuts 
are in <keycap>; menu commands are in <command>; terms when used for the first 
time are in <firstterm> (rendered as italic). Image references are simple, 
copy them from tutorial-basic.xml and replace just the filename.

If you want to build a tutorial then you can use the scripts make-html, make-svg, and make-all. The usage instructions and requirements are in these files. 

If you have Java 1.5, you may need to recompile the java class file:

 cd javaclasses/org/inkscape/xslt
 javac files.java
